---

## A. Security Baseline

- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (report email, supported versions, response timeline) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` README includes threat model paragraph (data touched, data NOT touched, permissions required) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` No secrets, tokens, or credentials in source or diagnostics output (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` No telemetry by default — state it explicitly even if obvious (2026-02-27)

### Default safety posture

- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: VS Code extension — not a CLI, MCP server, or desktop app
- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: VS Code extension — file operations constrained by VS Code workspace sandbox
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?` (2026-02-27) — error classification in catch blocks with contextual action buttons
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop app
- [x] `[vscode]` Errors surface via VS Code notification API — no silent failures (2026-02-27) — showErrorMessage with "Open Settings" actions

## C. Operator Docs

- [x] `[all]` README is current: what it does, install, usage, supported platforms + runtime versions (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` LICENSE file present and repo states support status (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: VS Code extension — logging via VS Code Output Channel
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[complex]` SKIP: focused extension, not complex enough for ops handbook

## D. Shipping Hygiene

- [x] `[all]` `verify` script exists (test + build + smoke in one command) (2026-02-27)

- [x] `[all]` Automated dependency update mechanism exists (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[npm]` SKIP: published as VSIX, not to npm
- [ ] `[npm]` SKIP: published as VSIX — engines.vscode set instead
- [x] `[npm]` Lockfile committed (2026-02-27) — package-lock.json
- [x] `[vsix]` `vsce package` produces clean .vsix with correct metadata (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop app
